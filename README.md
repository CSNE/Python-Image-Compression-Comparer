A simple program that lets you compare between various image compression parameters.

To run the program, simply copy all the files into a directory and then run the main.py.

Requirements: Any standard Python 3 installation (with tkinter) and Pillow.

The interface is pretty straightforward. Open an image, compress and compare, and save.

For the advanced users, this program has a batch conversion feature. You can also enter a python script to do a conditional conversion.
