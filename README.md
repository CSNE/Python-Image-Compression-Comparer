A simple program that lets you compare between various image compression parameters.

To run the program, simply copy all the files into a directory and then run the main.py.
Requirements: Any standard Python 3 installation (with tkinter) and Pillow.

The interface is pretty straightforward. Open an image, compress and compare, and save.
To change the number of images displayed, modify the num_images variable at main.py (line 400)
